                Developed a graphical editor for a post-doc researcherâ€™s modelling language alongside another student
                with no assistance. Written in Java, using JavaFX we used an MVC architecture and wrote custom low-level
                rendering code for the canvas. I gained experience in liaising with a client every week in which we adjusted
                the goals and required us to be agile with our development.

                                I'm a 4th year student at the University of Bristol studying for a MEng in Computer Science.
                                I have achieved a first class grade every year so far.
                                This summer I am interning in the innovations team at <a target="blank" href="https://www.hawkeyeinnovations.com">Hawk-Eye Innovations</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My interests at University are mainly Computer Vision and Machine Learning however I am always looking to learn about new
                                technologies and new areas of study. I am particulary keen to investigate the technology behind trading which aligns with
                                my greater interest in finance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The work I am undertaking at Hawk-eye is focused on Computer Vision and I have learned a great deal during my time there.
                                These include experimenting with state of the art stratified bundle adjustment algorithms, camera calibration in stadiums
                                including Major League Baseball and making improvements to various pieces of software.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Outside of my studies, I have been on the Kickboxing Society committee for the past two years, helping to run a club with
                                over 275 members (and hopefully more at the start of this academic year!). This has greatly developed me as a person and
                                improved my teamwork and communication. I also hold an Orange belt and have competed in several competitions, most notably
                                achieving 3rd place in my category at the Irish Open. I have run a half-marathon and enjoy playing football, frisbee and golf casually.
